class ContinuousFilterConvolution(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Continuous-filter convolution block as described by Sch端tt et al. (2018).

    Unlike convential convolutional layers that utilize discrete filter tensors,
    a continuous-filter convolutional layer evaluates the convolution at discrete
    locations in space using continuous radial filters (Sch端tt et al. 2018).

        x_i^{l+i} = (X^i * W^l)_i = \sum_{j=0}^{n_{atoms}} x_j^l \circ W^l (r_j -r_i)

    with feature representation X^l=(x^l_1, ..., x^l_n), filter-generating 
    network W^l, positions R=(r_1, ..., r_n) and the current layer l.

    A continuous-filter convolution block consists of a filter generating network
    as follows:

    Filter Generator:
        1. Featurization of cartesian positions into distances
           (which are roto-translationally invariant)
           (already precomputed so will be parsed as arguments)
        2. Atom-wise/Linear layer with shifted-softplus activation function
        3. Atom-wise/Linear layer with shifted-softplus activation function
           (see Notes)

    The filter generator output is then multiplied element-wise with the
    continuous convolution filter as part of the interaction block.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_gaussians: int
        Number of Gaussians that has been used in the radial basis function.
        Needed to determine the input feature size of the first dense layer.
    n_filters: int
        Number of filters that will be created. Also determines the output size.
        Needs to be the same size as the features of the residual connection in
        the interaction block.

    Notes
    -----
    Following the current implementation in SchNetPack, the last linear layer of
    the filter generator does not contain an activation function.
    This allows the filter generator to contain negative values.
